# QPX Express search app

* From this root directory, run `$ npm install` to install dependencies.

* Then run `$ webpack` to build the JavaScript file. Next, just open `dist/index.html` to run the app.

* Alternatively, skip building the file and access the app from a development server (at `localhost:8080`) by running `$ npm start`.

Note: requires an API key (`src/services/data.service.key.js`)
